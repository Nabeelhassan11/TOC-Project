# FOOD HUNGAMA

Last year, most food orders were placed over the phone during lockdown due to Covid 19. The main advantage of this app (Food Hungama) is that it makes the ordering process much easier for both the customer and the restaurant. When the customer visits for ordering, It is presented with an interactive and up-to-date menu complete with all available options. After making the selection, the item is added to their order, which the customer can check the details at any time before checking. It provides instant visual confirmation that the item has been selected and ensures that the items are in the order, and the entire ordering process is automated. Once orders are placed within the application, all items in the order are displayed in a comprehensive and easy-to-read way, with their respective options and delivery details. This allows restaurant employees to process orders faster as they prepare the necessary items with minimal delay and confusion.
